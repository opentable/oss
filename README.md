OpenTable Open Source
=========

This repository aims to be a resource for any team or individual
at OpenTable that wants to release their work as open source.

In this repository, you'll find the following:
* The approved [license][] for OpenTable projects (currently MIT).
* A CONTRIBUTING [template][contributing-template] - provides a
baseline document for contribution guidelines, but will need to
be completed for each project.

[license]: ../LICENSE
[contributing-template]: ../CONTRIBUTING.md
